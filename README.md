Final Course 2 Assignment submitted to the LSE

The Folder Consists of the following files

1. The Main assignment notebook with all the code, consisting of the 7 Sections, conclusions and recommendations:
"Suharevs_Vadims_DA201_Assignment_Notebook.ipynb"

2. Support file to be saved into the same folder as the "ipynb" notebook to run several codes within the notebook created to aid with deep dive analysis on locations:
"icb_ons_name.csv"
An external file had been chosen instead of creating a dictionary due to significant number of entries.

3. Technical report for the final submission which consists of the 7 Sections closely mirroring the ipynb file progress.
